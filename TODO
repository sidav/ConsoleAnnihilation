Closest plans:
- Further decrease the unit/building differentiation;
- better collision detection
- replace a single order var for pawns with an order queue
- Visual attack animations.
- Non-hitscan (projectile) weapons
- Explosions
- Separate log for each faction
- Separate AI struct for each ai-controlled faction
- Map and unit data reading from files
- Some "relay" resource for order giving?
- Working buildings animations and/or flickering

Fixes needed:
- Remove debug messages
- Add a bunker with marines (just joking)
- Add descriptions everywhere
- Add unit info function
