Not so close plans: 
- Naval units
- Random map generation

Closest plans:
- Further decrease the unit/building differentiation;
- better collision detection (it may be still buggish for buildings)
- replace a single order var for pawns with an order queue
- Visual attack animations.
- Non-hitscan (projectile) weapons
- Explosions
- Separate log for each faction
- Map and unit data reading from files
- Some "relay" resource for order giving?
- Working buildings animations and/or flickering
- Mouse support for console menus

Fixes needed:
- Remove debug messages
- Add descriptions to tiles
